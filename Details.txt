Recap:

  1. Component Life Cycle:

      Initialization: JS Loads the JSX into the memory

      Mounting: JSX gets loaded into the RealDOM

      Updating: Some contents or state gets updated in the Component JSX

      Unmounting: Removing the element from the RealDOM

  2. Life Cycle Hook - useEffect

      We are gonna target each of the phases and we are going to do something those phases( Mounting, Updating, Unmounting )

      Mounted: useEffect with Mounted
        Examples: Calculating initial value or loading some data from APIs
        
        useEffect(() => {
          // Statements to execute on Mouted phase 

        }, []);
    
      Updated: Liking a particular product / post in instagram
      useEffect(() => {
          // mounted is a boolean state for mounting
          if (mounted) {
            // Statements to execute on update phase 
            // dependency array is must

          }

        }, [<dep-val>]);
    

      Unmounting: Deleting a product from Cart
        useEffect(() => {
          
          return () => {
            // Statements to execute on un-Mouted phase 
          }

        }, []);
  
  3. Data Passing
      Parent -> Child
        Data as props child component
      Child  -> Parent
        pass a function as props to child component
        use that function to pass data argument to the parent component

  
Topics:

  1. CRUD implementations for the students or similar application 

      CRUD:
        C - Create
          Provide a form to create a new item, the created item should be displayed in the UI

        R - Read
          Read all the data from https://fakestoreapi.com/products?limit=5
          and display those records

        U - Update
          Update a select product
        D - Delete
          Delete a product from the list

  2. React-Router
    react-router-dom:
      Routing the DOM using the url path,

        uses window props location, history
    
      BrouserRouter:
        parent wrapper tag which includes the routes tag

      Routes:
        includes all the routes

      Route:
        route with a pathname binds a dom to the path
        
      Link:
        Link - anchor to a specific path
        Navigates from one page to the other page

      path params:
        useParams
      
      Default Route:
        default dom element when no route/path is found
  
      query params:
        useSearchParams
